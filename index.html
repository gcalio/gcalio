    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Hello there! My name is Giulia Calio and I'm a 29-year-old living in London, UK. <br />
        <br />
        I am a highly motivated and dynamic individual, focused on details and quick learner. 
        I have a background in PR and Communication and I’m currently developing my skills in Administration, 
        working on an Executive Assistant Diploma at the Lewis College. 
        I have a good knowledge of Social Media platforms, and my customer support experience helped me 
        to boost my problem solving and multi-tasking skills.<br />
        <br />
        I have always had a big passion for computers and one of my biggest regret is not choosing this major 
        for my studies. However, I believe it is not too late to follow your dreams so here I am self-learning 
        web development! Please have a look at my projects and get in touch!</p>
